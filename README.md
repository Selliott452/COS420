COS 420 UMaine Spring 2019

Professor: Sepideh Ghanavati


## Overview
We hope to solidify and optimize degree planning and college success by creating a web based application which will help manage student course planning over individual semesters, and their academic career. Students do not have a user-friendly application that allows them to manage their degree progress, leading to an overwhelming and time-consuming scheduling process. Thus, our hope is to develop an easy to use application which allows users to create and manage their schedules. We believe that this application will minimize scheduling errors, and, optimize degree planning which will save students time and money.
